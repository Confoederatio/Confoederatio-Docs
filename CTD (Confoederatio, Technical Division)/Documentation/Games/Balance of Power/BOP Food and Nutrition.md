**Nutrition** in the game is relative to each player, and works using the Five Food Groups: Dairy, Vegetables, Fruits, Grains, and Protein.

Each time the player consumes a food item, the corresponding category goes up by 1 to a maximum of 5. When a player is at their maximum in that category, they will be informed of it. Their nutrition can be viewed in the scoreboard on the right.

Every day, the score in each category goes down by 1.
