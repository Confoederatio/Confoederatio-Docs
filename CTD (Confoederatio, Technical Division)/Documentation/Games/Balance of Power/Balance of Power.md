**Balance of Power** is a realistic civilisational MP server project for Minecraft that is planned to take place on a real Earth map (1:500) between the years 1815-1914 during its release phase. Because of its experimental nature, it is first planned to have a pilot run during the first phase of the Bourbon Restoration followed by the Hundred Days.

Development was slated over the holidays (December 2025-January 2026) as a sort of winter break for Confoederatio members.
