**Balance of Power** is a realistic civilisational MP server project for Minecraft that is planned to take place on a real Earth map (1:500) between the years 1815-1914 during its release phase. Because of its experimental nature, it is first planned to have a pilot run during the first phase of the Bourbon Restoration followed by the Hundred Days.

Development was slated over the holidays (December 2025-January 2026) as a sort of winter break for Confoederatio members. Anything in the **Notes** folder of this project is reserved for references to the documentation of other plugins or vanilla quirks that are outside the control of Confoederatio.

## Features

See Also: [[BOP Configuration]] | [[BOP Artillery (Cannons)]], [[BOP Food and Nutrition]], [[BOP Technology]], [[BOP Vehicles (Movecraft)]], [[BOP Weapons (QualityArmory)]]

Since notes on Features come directly from the **planning and development** phase of the server's development, some of their actual implementation may be different in-game. When this occurs, we encourage players that notice to step up and inform relevant developers.
