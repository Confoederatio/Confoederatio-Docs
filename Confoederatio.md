**Confoederatio** is a standalone data science studio focusing on foundational infrastructure and complex datasets that was formed as a merger of the collective efforts of **11:59's Development Team**, **Boomsbury**, **Cats and Vultures**, **Midnight**, and **Confoederatio Studios**. Confoederatio currently manages ~30 active projects over four separate divisions, including the Preservés with work on technical and scientific tooling as well as arts and culture.

Note that documentation on this site is currently in the process of being migrated from older websites as well as physical documents. If there are any missing pieces of documentation that you are in need of, please contact members of Confoederatio responsible for that project directly.

## Organisation

All members of Confoederatio are pseudonymous with varying levels of affiliation. They must publish projects under these pseudonyms. Only full members of Confoederatio are listed as personnel, with them being flexibly divided between four divisions: Confoederatio, Artistic Division (**CAD**), which manages UI/UX; Confoederatio, Research Division (**CRD**), which manages applied research; and Confoederatio, Technical Division (**CTD**), which mainly works on games and backend frameworks.

## Personnel

Confoederatio has only two full members at the moment: Vis Tacitus (VIs), and Aust Kätzchen (Aust). Their contacts can be reached as follows:

## Publications and Software

Publications are covered under **CRD**, whilst software is split between CRD for research tooling and **CTD** for technical frameworks and game/software engine development. All publications and software are open-source and freely available on GitHub underneath an MIT Licence.
