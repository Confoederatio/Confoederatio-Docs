Forked from [[1.6b Falkland Plan]]:
S+00:
- Implement Features At Top, Geometries At Top setting
- Line segments should have their automatic labels drawn from their midpoint instead of the centre with configurable behaviour in settings (per line segment/for entire line)
- Finish implementing [[Naissance Label Editor]]
- Option to show marker image in leftbar hierarchy instead of default `<icon>marker</icon>`
- Symbol editors should be context-aware when populating data on `draw()` call
- Genericisation:
	- Add dynamic keymaps and ergonomics to settings
	- Lines should be labelled upon their midpoint by default, with a single label
	- Pop-up modal for [[GeometryLine]] and [[GeometryPoint]] controls since they can be confusing.
	- Geometry:
		- Split up draw() functions to be more modular
	- Hierarchy:
		- Should reflect and depend upon drawHierarchyDatatype() more than it currently does
- Settings:
	- Whether lab els are hidden by default should be toggleable for each Geometry type (populated dynamically)
- [[Vercengen]]:
	- Add ObjectInspector component
	- Genericise keybinds to all default components if possible (`.keybind`) using Mousetrap
	- .height/.width/.x/.y calculations for `ve.Window` should be able to incorporate the dynamic heights/widths/x/y coordinates of other windows if a template string is used.
	- Polish ve.Navbar so that it makes sense for production use
	- ve.SearchSelect needs to be completed before we can move onto mapmode scripting
	  
	- Add localisation framework for Vercengen to support multiple languages in core components (JSON with ££ delimiters, excluding `\£`)

S+01:
- Mapmode scripting with node-based editor using [[Maptalks]]
- Scripting editor should be kept generic so that it can be reused for Model Scripts and Agent Scripts
	- Boolean filters for geometries based on conditions
	- Symbol expressions for geometries, with a symbol registry in config that also determines `UI_Edit` interfaces dynamically
	- Default mapmode in UI
- Finish all Wiki articles and navbar menus
