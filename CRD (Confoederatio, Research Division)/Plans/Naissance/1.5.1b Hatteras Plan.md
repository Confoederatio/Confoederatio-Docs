(7 December 2025). Subject to change.

- Genericisation:
	- Geometry:
		- Unify hide geometry with keyframe hiding DONE
		- Move current keyframe to Geometry class DONE
		- .label_geometry should be moved to being .label_geometries, since we want to place multiple labels for MultiPolygons DONE
			- **NOTE.** This is subject to change in the future since .label_geometries will only make up the autopopulation part of the [[Naissance Label Editor]].
		- Finish localisation for GeometryPolygon history WIP
		- Add GeometryLine, GeometryPoint capabilities
			- Freehand line if brush selected; node-based editing if selected, draggable point if selected
			- Add generic labels to all geometries
