(9 December 2025). Subject to change.

- Finish setProperties()/setGeometries() for naissance.Geometry
- Change polygon/line/label editors to be more like UI_EditGeometryPoint
- Bugfixes:
	- Items in hierarchy can sometimes disappear. When this happens, make an emergency save and debug to see why hierarchy datatypes aren't being drawn
- Genericisation:
	- Add dynamic keymaps and ergonomics to settings
	- Pop-up modal for [[GeometryLine]] and [[GeometryPoint]] controls since they can be confusing.
	- Geometry:
		- Split up draw() functions to be more modular
	- Hierarchy:
		- Should reflect and depend upon drawHierarchyDatatype() more than it currently does
- Settings:
	- Whether lab els are hidden by default should be toggleable for each Geometry type (populated dynamically)
- [[Vercengen]]:
	- Add ObjectInspector component
	- Genericise keybinds to all default components if possible
	- .height/.width/.x/.y calculations for `ve.Window` should be able to incorporate the dynamic heights/widths/x/y coordinates of other windows if a template string is used.
	- ve.SearchSelect needs to be completed before we can move onto mapmode scripting
