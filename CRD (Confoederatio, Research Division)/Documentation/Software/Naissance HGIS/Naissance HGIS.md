**Naissance** is a historical GIS (HGIS) for any and all data, including data entry, proxy modelling, processing, visualisation, and simulation while being as frictionless as possible. To avoid UI/UX bloat, user interfaces are planned to take inspiration from game design, especially map-related grand-strategy/economy games.

**Naissance HGIS** is planned to remain in beta until it gains rough feature parity with the superset of CARTO, ESRI ArcGIS, QGIS, and Vensim, after which it will be used for the iteration and construction of new datasets such as [[Atlas]], [[Eoscala]], [[Sehistoir]], [[Stadestér]], or [[Velkscala]].
